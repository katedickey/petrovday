        Nuclear Monitoring and Control Instructional Supplement
      </h1>

      <p>This document is meant as a brief high-level overview of the interface for the Argus Nuclear Monitoring and Control System.</p>

      <ol class="indent">

      <li>
        <p>At the beginning of your shift, the site engineer will give you the URL and login credentials for the monitoring station:</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/1-authentication.png" /></div>
        </details>

        <p>(This password is your only authentication mechanism: keep tight hold of it.)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The monitoring station has one section for each enemy power, consisting of a launch button and a readout from the early warning system:</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/2-normal.png" /></div>
        </details>

        <p>The EWS works essentially by radar: sending out a pulse of radiation every second, and analyzing the echoes. There are occasional false positives, visible above, due to the anti-detection measures we suspect the enemy's missiles are equipped with.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If it is clear that another power has lauched at us, you are to retaliate immediately by pressing the launch button:</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/3-post-launch.png" /></div>
        </details>

        <p>Our missiles will take about three minutes to reach them: the countdown shows the estimated time until impact.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Our spies tell us that their monitoring tech (shown here on the right) is remarkably similar to ours, likely a result of their shameless espionage:</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/4-increased-readings.png" /></div>
        </details>

        <p>As you see, after about a minute, they'll have a pretty good idea that you've launched...</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>...and after about two minutes it will be unmistakeable:</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/5-very-increased-readings.png" /></div>
        </details>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>When an enemy power has been eliminated, either by us or by another, a reverse countdown will show -- it's possible that, in their expiring moments, they will have launched at us. There's nothing to be done at this point but wait.</p>
        <details class="indent"><summary>Show image</summary>
          <div class="screenshot-container"><img class="screenshot" src="./img/6-reverse-countdown.png" /></div>
        </details>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>With luck, they will have written off our launch as a malfunction until it was too late; when it's been long enough that we're sure we're safe, their EWS will deactivate.</p>
